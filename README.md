# CCHS-App-V1.2.1
An app developed for Cedar Crest High School primarily by another student, Lauren Johnston, and myself, and was released in August 2015. The app allows students and faculty to access important information about the school, including lunch schedules, sports schedules, club lists, the Talon and other school news, school store, maps, and two hour delay/closing notices.

Lunch schedules - See the main lunch selections for each day of the current month.

Sports schedules - See all of the sports games and information about those games for the current month.

Club lists - See all of the clubs, locations, and advisers sorted by the week they're held.

The Talon and other school news - View past editions of the Talon and read articles of news from around the district.

School store - View the school store's products and place orders.

Maps - See a map of the school and get visual and written directions on how to get between any two classrooms.

Two hours delay/closing notices - See updated alerts of closings/delays without having to search online.
